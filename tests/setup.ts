// This file configures the testing environment for Jest

// No need to manually declare globals as they should be picked up from @types/jest
// when properly configured in tsconfig.json

// Set up any global configurations needed for tests
console.log('Jest setup file loaded');

// Global setup/teardown can be configured in jest.config.js
// using globalSetup and globalTeardown if needed
